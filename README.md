# Hospital Patient Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze hospital patient data to extract meaningful insights and improve healthcare services. The analysis includes patient demographics, treatment outcomes, hospital utilization, and other key metrics, presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Patients**
- **Patient Satisfaction Score**
- **Service Not Rated**
- **Average Waiting Time**
- **Readmission Rate**
- **Percentage of Emergency Admissions**
- **Referred Patients**
- **Walk-in Patients**
- **Gender Distribution**
- **Department Referral**
- **Patient by Age Group**
- **Trend Analysis by Year & Months**
- **Patient Visits by Weektype**
- **Parameter on AM/PM**

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: Conducted data cleaning to ensure accuracy and integrity, adding new columns, handling missing values, and outliers.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Using DAX formulas for calculated columns and measures.
- **Data Sources**: Hospital patient dataset (CSV file).

## Dashboards
